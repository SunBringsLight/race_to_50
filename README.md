# race_to_50
Race To 50 is a simple game where the players roll a die until they get at least 50 dots total. The winner is whomever has the lowest number of rolls taken to reach the goal. This project is created in response to CodeAcademy's Full Stack Career Path course in creating a first project to practice JavaScript syntax.
